## National Energy Distribution Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Energy Supplied | 43.36 billion kWh |
| Total Billing | ₦2.14 trillion |
| Total Collection | ₦1.48 trillion |
| Average Collection Efficiency | **69.24%** |
| Total Revenue Loss | ₦659.57 billion |

---
## Distribution Company Performance Analysis
Based on collection efficiency and loss patterns, Ikeja Electric (IE) and Eko Electric (EKEDC) lead in operational reliability and financial health.

### Top Performing DisCos (by Collection Efficiency & Revenue Stability):
| DisCo | Collection Efficiency | Loss (₦) | Remarks |
|-------|------------------------|----------|---------|
| Ikeja Electric (IE) | High | ₦47.6bn | Largest energy distributor, consistent billing & collection |
| Eko Electric (EKEDC) | High | ₦37.3bn | Strong industrial base, minimal leakages |
| Abuja Electric (AEDC) | Moderate-High | ₦41.9bn | Covers Federal Capital, potential with intervention |

### ⚠️ DisCos with Major Revenue Leakages:
- **KE (₦104bn)** – Kano & parts of North: avoid due to poor infrastructure  
- **IBEDC, BEDC, EEDC (₦69bn – ₦95bn)** – High loss regions across Southwest, Mid-West, Southeast

---

### 🏙️ Recommended City: Lagos (Ikeja Industrial Zone)

- Band A zones with 20–24 hrs/day power
- Close to ports, airports, expressways
- Existing heavy industry and logistics network
- High-skilled labor availability  
- Multiple independent power producers (IPPs) support backup  

**Alternative:** Eko DisCo’s industrial clusters in Lagos Island, Apapa, and Ibeju-Lekki corridor

### 🏙️ Secondary Option: Abuja (AEDC – Band A zones)
- Federal Government backing ensures focus on infrastructure  
- Lower congestion than Lagos  
- Easy access to policy makers, public-private partnerships
- Good infrastructure in select zones
